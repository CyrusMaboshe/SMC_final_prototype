# Real-time Exam Slips Implementation

## Overview
Implemented real-time updates for exam slips so that when admins create, update, or delete exam slips, all students see the changes immediately in their dashboard without needing to refresh the page.

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Real-time Data Synchronization
- **Instant Updates**: Students see exam slip changes immediately when admins make modifications
- **Live Notifications**: Visual notifications appear when exam slips are created, updated, or deleted
- **Automatic Data Refresh**: Student exam slip data refreshes automatically without page reload

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Student Experience
- **Dynamic Table Updates**: The exam slip table shows real exam data instead of "TBA"
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time notifications with appropriate icons and colors
- **Seamless Integration**: Updates happen in the background without disrupting user experience

### ‚úÖ Admin Dashboard Integration
- **Bidirectional Updates**: Admin changes are reflected immediately across all student dashboards
- **Efficient Data Loading**: Optimized queries to fetch exam slips with course enrollment data

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Structure
```sql
-- Exam slips table with proper relationships
exam_slips (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
  lecturer_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  exam_date DATE NOT NULL,
  exam_time TIME NOT NULL,
  venue TEXT NOT NULL,
  academic_year TEXT NOT NULL,
  semester INTEGER NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES system_users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Real-time Subscriptions
- **Supabase Real-time**: Uses PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY for instant updates
- **Channel Management**: Separate channels for different user types
- **Event Filtering**: Filters events by table and operation type

### 3. API Enhancements
```typescript
// New API method for students
async getEnrolledCoursesWithExamSlips(studentId: string) {
  // Fetches courses with associated exam slip data
  // Includes lecturer info, exam details, and scheduling
}
```

### 4. Custom Hooks
- **useExamSlipUpdates**: Generic hook for real-time exam slip updates
- **useStudentExamSlipUpdates**: Student-specific implementation
- **useAdminExamSlipUpdates**: Admin-specific implementation
